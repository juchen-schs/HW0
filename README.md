```
A well-formed Java program has
a main method with { and }
braces.

A System.out.println statement

## Exercise 4: Difference
Write a complete Java program in a class named `Difference` that prints the following output:
```
What is the difference between
a ' and a "?  Or between a " and a \"?

## Exercise 5: MuchBetter

'' is not the same as "
